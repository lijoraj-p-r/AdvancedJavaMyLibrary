# 💡 Master Core Java – One File at a Time 💻

Welcome to **My Core Java Problem-Solving Library** —  
Your one-stop reference for real, hands-on **Java code**, built from scratch, by me.  
Whether you're prepping for interviews, brushing up concepts, or building muscle memory — this repo has you covered.

## 🔥 Why This Exists

I built this library for:

✅ Practicing real-world Java problems  
✅ Revising OOP, Collections, Streams, Multithreading  
✅ Building confidence through consistent coding  
✅ Sharing clean, reusable, understandable code with the world

No frameworks, no dependencies — just **pure Java power**.
