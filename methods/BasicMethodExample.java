üìù Method Components Explained (from KodNest)
-------------------------------------

1. Access Modifier (e.g., public, private):
   - Controls who can access the method.
   - Think of it as a key to a door‚Äîwho is allowed to enter?
   - Example: `public` makes it accessible from anywhere.

2. Return Type (e.g., void, int, String):
   - Defines what type of value the method returns.
   - If no return value is needed, use `void`.

3. Method Name (e.g., sayHello, addNumbers):
   - A descriptive name to refer to the method.
   - Should reflect what the method does.

4. Parameters (e.g., int num1, int num2):
   - Inputs you pass into the method.
   - Think of them as ingredients for the task.
   - Can be empty `()` if no input is needed.

üí° Why Are Methods So Powerful?
   - Reuse: Write once, use multiple times.
   - Organization: Keeps code clean and readable.
   - Flexibility: Accept different inputs and return different results.

üöÄ Example Purpose:
   - This simple program demonstrates creating and calling a method (`addNumbers`)
     that adds two integers and returns the result.
