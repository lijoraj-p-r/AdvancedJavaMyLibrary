This Java code demonstrates the order of execution during the lifecycle of a class. Let's walk through how it flows, step-by-step:

### 1. **Static Variable Initialization**

* The class `FlowExample` contains a **static variable**:

  ```java
  static int staticVar = 10;
  ```

  * This variable is initialized when the class is loaded into memory by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Static variables are shared among all instances of the class.

### 2. **Static Block Execution**

* When the class is loaded, the **static block** is executed once, **before any instance or method** is called.

  ```java
  static {
      System.out.println("Static block executed. staticVar = " + staticVar);
      staticVar = 30;
  }
  ```

  * This block prints the value of `staticVar` (which is `10` at that moment) and then modifies it to `30`.
  * Static blocks are useful for initializing static variables or executing one-time setups.

### 3. **Main Method Execution**

* The `main` method starts executing when you run the program:

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Main method started.");
  ```

  * The first line prints `"Main method started."` to the console.

### 4. **Calling Static Method**

* The `staticMethod()` is called from the main method:

  ```java
  staticMethod();
  ```

  * The static method prints:

    ```java
    System.out.println("Static method executed. staticVar = " + staticVar);
    ```
  * Since static methods can access static variables, it prints `"Static method executed. staticVar = 30"` (because `staticVar` was changed to `30` earlier).

### 5. **Instance Creation**

* An instance of `FlowExample` is created:

  ```java
  FlowExample example = new FlowExample();
  ```

  * This triggers the **instance block**, **constructor**, and **instance methods**. Let's break this down further.

### 6. **Instance Block Execution**

* The **instance block** is executed when an instance of the class is created:

  ```java
  {
      System.out.println("Instance block executed. instanceVar = " + instanceVar);
      instanceVar = 40;
  }
  ```

  * This block prints the initial value of `instanceVar` (which is `20` by default), then changes it to `40`.
  * The output will be:

    ```
    Instance block executed. instanceVar = 20
    ```

### 7. **Constructor Execution**

* After the instance block, the **constructor** is called:

  ```java
  public FlowExample() {
      System.out.println("Constructor executed. instanceVar = " + instanceVar);
  }
  ```

  * It prints the value of `instanceVar` after the instance block has executed (which is now `40`).
  * The output will be:

    ```
    Constructor executed. instanceVar = 40
    ```

### 8. **Calling Instance Method**

* Next, the `instanceMethod()` is called for the created instance:

  ```java
  example.instanceMethod();
  ```

  * This method prints:

    ```java
    System.out.println("Instance method executed. instanceVar = " + instanceVar);
    ```
  * The instance method accesses `instanceVar`, which was changed to `40` during the instance block. Thus, it prints:

    ```
    Instance method executed. instanceVar = 40
    ```

### 9. **Main Method Completion**

* Finally, the main method prints:

  ```java
  System.out.println("Main method ended.");
  ```

  * This will be the last output:

    ```
    Main method ended.
    ```

### Complete Output Order:

1. `"Static block executed. staticVar = 10"`
2. `"Static method executed. staticVar = 30"`
3. `"Main method started."`
4. `"Instance block executed. instanceVar = 20"`
5. `"Constructor executed. instanceVar = 40"`
6. `"Instance method executed. instanceVar = 40"`
7. `"Main method ended."`

### Summary of Flow:

1. The **static block** runs once when the class is loaded, before any instance or method is called.
2. The **main method** starts, calling the static method first.
3. When the object `example` is created:

   * The **instance block** executes, followed by the **constructor**.
   * Finally, the **instance method** is called for the object.

This demonstrates how static and instance elements in a class interact and execute in a specific order in Java.
